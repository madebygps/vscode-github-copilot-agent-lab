- **Skip ahead** if you're short on time
- **Compare your work** against the expected outcome  
- **Recover** if something went wrong
- **Learn** by examining the code changes

## How to Use a Checkpoint

### Option 1: Copy files to your project
```bash
# From repo root, copy a checkpoint's SocOps folder
cp -r .solutions/step-04-redesign-cyberpunk/SocOps ./SocOps
```

### Option 2: Run a checkpoint directly
```bash
cd .solutions/step-04-redesign-cyberpunk/socops
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Option 3: Compare your changes
```bash
# See what changed in a step
diff -r SocOps .solutions/step-04-redesign-cyberpunk/SocOps
```

## Workshop Guide Reference

See [`.lab/GUIDE.md`](../.lab/GUIDE.md) for the full workshop instructions.
